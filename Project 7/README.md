## Receptive Field
Receptive Field Calculation for GoogLeNet incarnation of Inception architecture from Research Paper: **Going Deeper with Convolutions** available [here
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf)
Below are the major formulas needed to compute *receptive field* for an architecture:

> RF*: New receptive field size added by that layer  
> Jin: Value of Jin for that layer  
> Padding has been calculated by comparing the channel output size from parallel layers
